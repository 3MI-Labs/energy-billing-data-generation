# Energy Billing: Data Generation
This repository contains the code used to generate the production and consumption data for the Energy Billing project.

## Structure
This repository contains several Jupyter notebooks used to generate the data.
- **[wind.ipynb](wind/wind.ipynb)**. Generate wind power production data.
- **[pv.ipynb](pv/pv.ipynb)**. Generate photo voltaic production data.
- **[consumption.ipynb](consumption/consumption.ipynb)**. Generate user electricity consumption data.
- **[generation.ipynb](generation.ipynb)**. Combine the data generated by the other notebooks into a usable dataset.
